Hi! I make mods for nintendo switch games. I also do some misc c/c++ and rust projects.

My goal is to make all my mods public and open source. If you don't see one of my mods from a vid here, it's likely because I haven't had time to publish it.
If there's a pecific mod of mine that you want or you have a small mod request then DM me!
